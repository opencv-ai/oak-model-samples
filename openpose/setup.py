    "description": "OpenPose is an industry standard in human body keypoint detection."
    " Given an image of multiple people, the algorithm finds the "
    "keypoints like nose, elbows and knees (17 in total) for everyone. "
    "Then the model builds a skeleton-like representation for every "
    "person on the image. The model was trained on large [MS COCO] "
    "dataset, and because of this, it generalizes well to a multitude "
    "of real-life usecases like surveillance, security, or sports. "
    "This implementation of OpenPose was done by "
    "[IntelÂ® OpenVINO](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/tools/openvino-toolkit.html) "
    "team, and it was specifically optimized for fast inference on "
